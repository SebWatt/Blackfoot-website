        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This website describes an introduction to the Treaty 7, which the
          Blackfoot people signed in 1877. It guides you through life before the
          treaty, what the treaty is and when the treaty was signed, the impact
          of the treaty, and what life is like now.

        <h2>Life before Treaty 7</h2>
        <p>
          According to the Glenbow Museum, the traditional territory of the </br>
          Blackfoot Confederacy “extended from Ponokasisahta </br>(Elk River, now
          called the North Saskatchewan River) </br>south to Otahkoitahtayi (the
          Yellowstone River).” It goes on to say </br>that the Blackfoot people
          “lived along the eastern slopes of the </br>Rocky Mountains and eastward
          beyond Omahskispatsikoyii </br>(the Great Sand Hills in what is now called
          Saskatchewan).” </br>Because they moved throughout their territory
          regularly the Blackfoot </br>people knew their land well. They knew where
          to find what they needed </br>to stay alive throughout every season.
          According to Sheldon First Rider, </br>Blackfoot elder and Glenbow
          Educator “all living things equal and </br>have a purpose, right to pass
          through the cycle of life from birth </br>to death.” The examples he gives
          include plants that can cure </br>diseases and buffalo giving their
          Ancestors almost everything needed </br>to survive. The Lives of the
          Blackfoot People were very closely </br>connected to their traditional land
          and depended on their ability to </br>travel through it.</p>

        <h2>What was Treaty 7 and when were they signed</h2>
        <p>In 1877 the Blackfoot People were one of five First Nations to sign Treaty 7 </br>
          with the Canadien Government. However, it was not the first Treaty </br> that they signed, 
          in 1855 they signed a treaty with the United States government, </br> which was trying to 
          build a railroad across the continent. The Glenbow Muesum states, </br>“At the time, 
          the government promised to recognize the vast territory of our people.” </br> 
          When the Blackfoot people met with the Canadian Government, the Glenbow Muesum </br>
          Points out, “they thought they were making an agreement to help one another</br>
          adjust to a new way of life. They did not understand that the government wanted
          all rights </br>to the land.” The Treaty was finally signed on what is now the Siksika
          Nation </br> Reserve on September 22nd, 1877. It is one of the 11 numbered treaties
          signed between </br>First nations and the crown between 1871 and 1921. </p>

        <h2>The Impact of the Treaty 7</h2>
        <p>By the late 1800’s there were so few buffalo on the prairie that the Blackfoot </br>
          people suffered starvation. When they asked the Canadian Gouvernement for </br>help,
          they were told to look for buffalo in the United States. In 1880 they were </br>forced
          to move to the reserved land to start their new way of life there. They </br>had to
          rely on government rations for food, they needed to farm by hand rather </br>than 
          using the tools available to other farmers at the time, and they had to send </br>
          their children to residential schools. The treaty did not prevent disease from </br>
          breaking out. In 1893 many children died from measles. Although these problems </br>
          began in the late 1800’s they continued throughout much of the 1900’s. </p>

        <h2>What's life like now</h2>
        <p>After a long century, the Blackfoot people began to regain control </br>of their lives.
        According to the Glenbow Muesum “Piikani took control </br>of their education system
        in 1986”. Later “The Kainai built the Blood Tribe </br>Irrigation Project in 1994 to
        provide money for their health, education, and </br>welfare projects.” Also, The
        Blackfoot people have been able to retain a lot </br>of their traditional culture.
        Many Blackfoot people still farm and ranch, but </br>they also own businesses and
        extract minerals from their land, which are </br>rich in natural resources. The Canadian
        encyclopedia says “the confederacy </br>joined other First Nations in signing the Iinii
        Treaty or Buffalo Treaty. Among </br>other issues, the signatories agreed to unite the
        political power of Northern Plains </br>Indigenous nations, work towards bison
        conservation and strengthen traditional </br>relationships to the land.” </p>
